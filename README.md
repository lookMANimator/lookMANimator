# Hi there, I'm Luqman Azman! 👋

**`Data Analytics Student | Turning Data into Insights`**

I'm a passionate data analytics student who loves uncovering stories hidden in data. When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll find me exploring the game development side of the digital world and made a soul promise to create a indie game.

> 🚀 *Currently seeking internship opportunities in Data Analytics*

### ⚡ Project 3: Recreating The PacMan Game

**Tech Stack:** C++, Unity  

Made for my Artificial Intelligent course, mainly focusing on the AI pathfinding to determine it's next position in reaching it's respective destination. As there are 4 different ghost in PacMan in which each of them have their own AI pathfinding by closing in with the player, blocking the player next move or even trapping the player.
